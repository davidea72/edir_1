a simple program in python to use the EDIR hardware
released under GNU GPLv3

The EDIR is a small piece of hardware to receive, decode and transmit the IR signal from many remote command

http://www.electrodragon.com/product/ir-infrared-signal-forwarder-decoder-edir/
http://www.electrodragon.com/w/EDIR

it has a serial port to connect with an arduino, an esp8266 or a simple usb to serial TTL adapter

in this first draft i write a small program for my pc in python (i'm not a programmer)

the EDIR hardware dialog with serial protocol 9600 baud 8 N 1
it has some command , sent as hex byte

FAF2 ask to print the version
FAF5 start learning IR code with auto frequency acquire and exit

	it seems don't work , enter in learning mode but only sometime read the ir command and we don't know when 
	and why it exit from learning mode

FAFD start learning IR code without auto frequency acquire 
FAF4  stop learning, we don't know when send it ....

FAF8 enter in sleep mode

FAF7 wake from sleep mode
FAF3 repeat
FAF6 reset
FA is the first byte of the answer
ED is the last byte of the answer

the edir , when execute a command anser with a 00 result if it's execution is ok and with FF if it's not ok
when answer with the decoded ir command the first byte is 00 and after start with FA

#test
#        FA         18       25       xx xx xx xx xx       FC   ED
#     frame header       frequency                      check sum
#               data length          data packet                end
